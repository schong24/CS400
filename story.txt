In a small town in Rochester, NY, there was a boy named Jake Torrell. He was a talented athlete who was good at soccer, football, baseball, and basketball. 
Couches from all teams in Rochester area wanted to have him in their team. One day, it was Homecoming, and he was playing soccer as a defender. It was corner for the opponent team.
The ball went in the air, and Jake and striker's from other team jumped together for the header. At that moment, he passed out. --Written by Seungjun Chong (Jayden)
